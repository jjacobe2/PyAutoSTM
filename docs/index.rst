  PyAutoSTM
===============
``PyAutoSTM`` is a library developed for aiding with automating
experiments in low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, specifically
with systems controlled using the Nanonis V5 SPM Controller software.

The main application of this library is for automating the assembly
of CO patterns on copper substrates to examine the interesting physics
arising from these many body configurations.
